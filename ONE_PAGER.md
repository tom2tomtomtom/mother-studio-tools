# Uncommon Studio AI Tools

### The AI Operating System for Creative Agencies

---

**Your entire agency — 10 departments, 78 workflows, one platform.**

Every department in your agency does work that AI can accelerate. The problem isn't access to AI — it's knowing *which* tool to use, *how* to use it, and getting consistent quality across 30+ people. Uncommon Studio AI Tools solves that on day one.

## Every Department. Day One.

Creative -- Strategy -- Account Management -- Production -- Design -- Digital -- Copywriting -- New Business -- Project Management -- Studio Operations

Each department gets purpose-built prompts, skills, and plugins matched to their actual daily work — not a one-size-fits-all chatbot.

## What Makes This Different

**Built by agency people.** Every prompt references frameworks your team already knows. This isn't "write me a blog post" — it's "sharpen this brief using the single-minded proposition, identify the human tension, and rewrite it with measurable objectives."

**Multi-tool, not tool-locked.** We teach your team to use the right tool for each job: Claude Projects for brand knowledge, Cowork for desktop automation, Perplexity for live research, Runway for video, ElevenLabs for voice. One platform, full ecosystem.

**Self-hosted & private.** Deploys on your infrastructure. Client work never touches third-party servers. Critical for NDA-protected brand work.

**Training included.** 18 comprehensive guides mean your team ramps up without expensive consultants or months of trial-and-error.
