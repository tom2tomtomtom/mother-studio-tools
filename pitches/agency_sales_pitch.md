# What If Half Your Agency's Busywork Disappeared This Week?

Your team's already using AI. The problem is they're using it badly — rewriting the same ChatGPT prompt six different ways, getting inconsistent results, and wasting time on work that should take minutes, not hours.

We fix that. In a day.

## Here's What We Actually Automate

**New Business & Pitches** — RFP assessment, proposal drafting, pitch deck generation, capability statements. One Claude Skill scores an RFP opportunity against your win criteria and spits out a go/no-go recommendation before you've finished your coffee. Another builds the response structure. A Cowork Plugin lets anyone on your team type `/rfp-response` and get a first draft assembled from your past wins, case studies, and credentials.

**Strategy & Research** — Competitive analysis, brand positioning, audience research, cultural insights. Instead of a strategist spending two days on a competitor landscape, a purpose-built Skill pulls it together in minutes — formatted to your agency's framework, not a generic AI dump.

**Content & Copy** — Blog posts, social copy, email sequences, content calendars, brand voice enforcement. Your copywriters don't lose their voice — they get a Skill that learns your client's tone and enforces it every time. A `/content-calendar` command builds a month of content mapped to campaign objectives.

**Media & PR** — Press releases, media pitches, journalist targeting, coverage reports, crisis communications. The crisis comms Skill uses the REACT framework your team already knows. Type `/media-statement` and you're drafting within seconds of a story breaking.

**Account Management** — Meeting notes, client health checks, stakeholder updates, status reports. Your account team types `/status-report` and gets a client-ready update pulled from project data — not a blank page they have to fill in from scratch.

**Reporting & Analytics** — Campaign performance reports, SEO audits, UX reviews, analytics dashboards. The work your digital team dreads — formatting weekly reports, pulling metrics, writing insights — gets compressed from hours to minutes.

**Production & Operations** — Specs, vendor briefs, delivery checklists, resource planning, process documentation, onboarding guides. The operational backbone nobody wants to maintain but everybody needs.

## What's Under the Hood

This isn't a prompt library someone Googled together. It's a fully engineered system built on Anthropic's Claude platform using three layers of automation:

**Claude Skills** — Packaged, repeatable AI workflows your team installs once and runs identically every time. Think of them as expert-level templates that enforce your agency's quality standards across 33 different workflows. One-click install into Claude. No code. No setup. They just work.

**Cowork Plugins** — Desktop automation that runs on your team's actual computers. Slash commands (`/press-release`, `/competitor-analysis`, `/project-plan`) that create real documents, fill real spreadsheets, and organise real files. Twelve plugins covering every department, with more buildable to your specs.

**Expert Prompts** — 78 battle-tested prompts built around actual agency frameworks (REACT for crisis, RAID for account management, WBS for project planning). These aren't generic. They reference the methodologies your senior people already use — now everyone on the team has access to that thinking.

Everything deploys on your infrastructure. Client data stays in your environment. No third-party servers seeing your NDA-protected brand work.
