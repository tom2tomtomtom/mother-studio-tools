## The Problem They Don't Know They Have

Every agency has people using AI. That's not the problem.

The problem is **how** they're using it. Right now, across most agencies, it looks like this:

- A copywriter has a ChatGPT tab open and types "write me some social posts for Nike" — gets generic slop, rewrites 80% of it, and thinks "AI isn't that useful"
- A strategist spends 20 minutes explaining the client's brand, category, and competitors to Claude — **every single time** they start a new conversation, because the AI forgets everything
- An account director manually writes the same status report format every Friday — never realising AI could do it in 30 seconds if someone had set it up properly
- Three people in the same agency use three different AI tools with three different approaches and get wildly inconsistent quality

**Nobody has a system.** Everyone is freelancing their own AI usage. The result: inconsistent quality, wasted time re-explaining context, and most of the team thinking AI "doesn't really work for what I do."

The agency doesn't know it needs an AI operating system for the same reason a company in 2005 didn't know it needed Slack — they've been solving the problem with duct tape and individual effort, and they assume that's just how it works.

## What We've Built — And What It Actually Does

We've built an **Agency AI Operating System**. Here's what that means in plain English.

### The Platform (What They See)

It's a **clean, searchable internal website** — branded to the agency — that every employee opens when they need AI to help with their work. Think of it as the agency's AI homepage.

They see their department. They see the task they need to do. They click it.

That's it. No AI expertise required.

**Example: A copywriter needs to write social content for a client.**

She opens the platform, goes to "Copywriting," clicks "Social Copy Writer." She sees:
- Exactly what AI tool to use (and why)
- What files to upload (the client's brand voice guide, campaign brief, past posts)
- A battle-tested prompt — not "write me social posts" but a detailed, structured instruction that produces agency-quality output the first time

She copies it. Pastes it into Claude. Gets back platform-specific posts with the right tone, right hashtags, right character counts. Done in 2 minutes instead of 45.

**Now multiply that across 10 departments and 78 workflows.**

The platform covers the daily work of every agency role:

| Someone needs to... | They open... | And get... |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| Generate campaign concepts from a brief | Creative > Campaign Concept Generator | 5 distinct territories with executions across TV, social, OOH, digital |
| Write a press release | Media & PR > Media Release Writer | AP-style release with proper structure, quotes, boilerplate |
| Prepare a client status report | Account Management > Stakeholder Update | RAG-rated report with milestones, risks, and next steps |
| Analyse a competitor | Strategy > Competitor Analysis | Positioning map, messaging breakdown, gap analysis |
| Scope a new project | Project Management > Project Scope | WBS breakdown, timeline, resource requirements, risk register |
| Review creative work against a brief | Creative > Creative Review | Structured scoring against brief objectives with actionable feedback |
| Respond to a crisis | PR > Crisis Comms Drafter | Holding statement, stakeholder messaging, media Q&A |

### Skills (The "Apps" Layer)

Think of Skills as **apps you install in Claude** that teach it a specific process.

Without a Skill, you have to explain what you want every time — "write me a press release, use AP style, include a quote from the CEO, structure it with headline then dateline then..." Every. Single. Time.

With a Skill installed, you just say: *"Use the Media Release skill. Here's the announcement."* Claude already knows the format, the style, the structure. It runs the same process every time, for every person on the team.

We've built **33 of these** — covering everything from brand positioning workshops to QA testing reports. They install in one click (download a zip file, upload to Claude) and stay in the user's account permanently.

**Why this matters:** It's the difference between giving someone a blank word processor and giving them a document template. The template doesn't replace their thinking — it eliminates the repetitive setup so they can focus on the actual work.

### Plugins (The "Autopilot" Layer)

Plugins go one step further. They let people type a **simple command** and the AI does the work on their actual computer — opening apps, creating documents, filling in spreadsheets.

Instead of copy-pasting between windows, someone types `/status-report` and the AI:
- Pulls the project information
- Structures it into the agency's standard format
- Creates the document
- Fills in milestones, risks, and next steps

We've built **12 plugin bundles** — one for each agency function (Brand Strategy, Campaign Management, Crisis Comms, Media Relations, etc.) with 3 commands each. That's 36 automated workflows ready to go.

**Why this matters:** Most agency employees will never set this up themselves. The setup is the barrier. We remove it completely — they just type a command and it works.

### Training Guides (The "University" Layer)

**18 comprehensive guides** that teach the team how to use every AI tool in the ecosystem — not just ours. Claude Projects, desktop automation, AI video (Runway), AI voice (ElevenLabs), AI presentations (Gamma), research tools (Perplexity), workflow automation (n8n), and more.

Each guide has difficulty ratings, time estimates, and step-by-step instructions. It's an onboarding accelerator — new hires are productive with AI in days, not months.

## Why They Don't Know They Need This (Yet)

Agencies are in the same place with AI that they were with project management software in 2010. Everyone was "managing projects" — in spreadsheets, emails, sticky notes, and their heads. It worked. Sort of. Until someone showed them Basecamp or Asana and they realised how much time they'd been wasting.

Right now, agencies think their AI situation is fine because:

- **"We have ChatGPT/Claude subscriptions"** — Yes, and you have Microsoft Word too. That doesn't mean everyone writes great documents. The tool isn't the system.
- **"Our people are using it"** — Some are. Inconsistently. With zero shared standards. The junior copywriter's AI output doesn't match the senior strategist's, and neither matches the brand voice.
- **"We did an AI training day"** — Great. What changed 30 days later? Without a platform to reinforce the training, people revert to old habits within 2 weeks.
- **"We'll build something internally"** — With what team? What budget? What timeline? Custom internal tools cost $150-300K+ and take 6-9 months. 45% go over budget (McKinsey).

The moment an agency sees a competitor delivering pitches in half the time, producing 40% more content, or responding to crises in minutes instead of hours — they'll realise they needed a system six months ago.

We're selling the system before that panic moment hits.

## What's Actually Built

This isn't a pitch deck about something we plan to build. The platform is **production-ready, deployed, and working.**

- **28,000 lines of production code** — modern tech stack, deployable in a day
- **78 expert prompts** — 6,000+ lines of agency-specific AI instructions
- **33 downloadable skills** — packaged and ready to install
- **12 automation plugins** — built, tested, documented
- **18 training guides** — comprehensive, with difficulty levels and time estimates
- **Replacement cost: $206,000+. Build time: 6-9 months.** It's already done.

## How We Make Money

Five revenue streams that feed each other:

| Stream | Price | Type |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Implementation packages** — deploy + customize + train | $15K - $40K per agency | Project |
| **SaaS subscriptions** — hosted access, monthly | $499 - $2,499/mo | Recurring |
| **White-label licenses** — holding companies, consultancies | $25K - $350K | Project + recurring |
| **Retainers** — ongoing AI transformation partner | $3K - $25K/mo | Recurring |
| **Workshops** — half-day, full-day, keynotes | $3K - $25K per event | Project + lead gen |

Every workshop sells subscriptions. Every subscription upsells to a retainer. Every retainer produces a case study that sells the next 10 clients.

## The Market

This isn't speculative. The demand exists right now.

- **$473B** global agency market, growing at 4.5% annually
- **$5.1B** agency management software market, projected to hit **$18.3B by 2033**
- **AI agents market** hit $7.6B in 2025, projected **$183B by 2033** (49.6% CAGR)
- **76% of agencies buy rather than build** their AI tools
- Agencies using AI report **40% faster content production** and **3.7x ROI**

The window is now. In 12-18 months, this space will be crowded. Today, there is **no purpose-built Agency AI OS** on the market. Competitors cover one slice each (ads, content, or project management). Nobody covers all 10 departments.

---

## Why We Win

**Already built.** The hard part is done. Competitors would need $200K+ and 6-9 months to catch up.

**Domain expertise baked in.** Every prompt references real agency frameworks — REACT for crisis comms, RAID logs for account management, WBS for project planning. This was built by someone who's lived in agencies, not by a developer who Googled "advertising prompts."

**Multi-tool, not tool-locked.** We don't force agencies into one AI platform. We teach them the right tool for each job — Claude for brand knowledge, Perplexity for research, Runway for video, n8n for automation. That's a moat competitors can't copy without rebuilding from the ground up.

**Self-hosted.** Client data stays on their infrastructure. For agencies handling NDA-protected brand work, this is a dealbreaker feature that SaaS competitors can't offer.

## Revenue Projections

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|---|--------|--------|--------|
| **Conservative** | $555K | $1.3M | $2.4M |
| Revenue mix | 50% recurring | 60% recurring | 65%+ recurring |

These numbers assume a solo operator with occasional subcontractors in Year 1, scaling to a small team in Year 2. No venture capital required. Profitable from month one — there's no inventory, no manufacturing, no COGS beyond hosting.

---

## What I'm Looking For in a Partner

The product is built. The sales materials are ready. What accelerates this is a partner who brings:

- **Sales relationships** — access to agency networks, holding companies, or conference stages
- **Credibility** — agency leadership experience, industry reputation, or consulting background
- **Operational capacity** — help delivering workshops, managing client onboarding, or scaling the SaaS
- **Capital** (optional) — not required, but could accelerate hiring and marketing

This is a partnership, not an investment pitch. The business model works at small scale (solo) and large scale (team). The question is how fast we want to move.

## Next Step

Let's talk. I'll walk you through the platform live, show you the sales pipeline, and discuss how we'd structure this.

The platform is ready. The market is ready. The only question is whether we move now or watch someone else build it.
