## Business Model: Selling to Agencies

---

## The Core Insight

You don't sell a website. You sell a **transformation** — from "our team is dabbling with ChatGPT" to "every department has AI workflows running on day one." The platform is the delivery mechanism. The value is the outcome.

This document covers **five distinct business models** you can run simultaneously — each targeting a different buyer type, price point, and sales motion.

---

## Model 1: Productized Implementation Package
### "Done-With-You AI Rollout"

**Target:** Individual agencies (15-100 people) who know they need AI but don't know where to start.

**What You Sell:**

| Phase | Deliverable | Timeline |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Discovery** | 90-min workshop: audit current AI usage, identify top 5 department pain points, map quick wins | Week 1 |
| **Customization** | Fork the platform, rebrand to client's identity, select and configure the 30-40 most relevant prompts for their specific vertical and clients | Week 2-3 |
| **Deployment** | Deploy to their infrastructure (Railway/Vercel/internal), configure AI chat widget with their API keys | Week 3 |
| **Training** | 2x half-day workshops — one for leadership (strategy + ROI), one for practitioners (hands-on prompt usage) | Week 4 |
| **Handoff** | Admin guide, 30-day email support, usage check-in at day 30 and day 60 | Week 5-8 |

**Pricing:**

| Package | What's Included | Price |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| **Essentials** | Platform + 40 prompts + 1 training session + 30-day support | **$15,000** |
| **Professional** | Platform + all 78 prompts + 33 skills + 2 training sessions + 60-day support + custom prompts (up to 10) | **$25,000** |
| **Premium** | Everything + 12 plugins + custom department prompts (up to 25) + quarterly review (1 year) | **$40,000** |

**Why this works:** AI training workshops alone cost [$1,000-$3,000/day per person](https://www.bizzuka.com/how-much-does-ai-training-for-businesses-cost/). For a 30-person agency, two half-day workshops would cost $30,000-$90,000 from a training company — and they wouldn't get a platform. You're bundling training + platform + customization for less than training alone.

**Unit economics:**
- Your time: ~40-60 hours per engagement
- COGS: ~$0 (platform is already built)
- Effective hourly rate: $250-$1,000/hr
- Capacity: 2-3 clients/month solo, 5-6 with one subcontractor

**Annual revenue at capacity:** $450,000 - $1,440,000

---

## Model 2: Monthly SaaS Subscription
### "AI Tools as a Service"

**Target:** Agencies that want self-serve access without a big upfront commitment.

**What You Sell:** Hosted, managed access to the platform with your branding, ongoing prompt updates, and support.

**Pricing Tiers:**

| Tier | Seats | Monthly | Annual | Includes |
|------|-------|---------|--------|----------|
| **Starter** | Up to 15 | $499 | $4,990 | All prompts, 4 plugins, all guides, email support |
| **Growth** | Up to 50 | $999 | $9,990 | Everything + all 12 plugins + all 33 skills + custom branding |
| **Enterprise** | Unlimited | $2,499 | $24,990 | Everything + up to 25 custom prompts + Slack support + quarterly reviews |

**Add-ons:**
- Custom prompt development: $500/prompt
- Custom plugin development: $2,500/plugin
- Training workshop (half-day, virtual): $2,500
- Training workshop (full-day, on-site): $5,000 + travel

**Why this works:** Comparable tools charge $29-$249/seat/month (MagicBrief, Foreplay, Writer.com). Your pricing is per-org, not per-seat — which is massively cheaper for agencies and a clear differentiator. A 30-person agency paying $999/mo is effectively paying $33/seat — cheaper than any competitor while getting 10x the department coverage.

**Revenue projections:**

| Scenario | Year 1 Clients | MRR | ARR |
|----------|---------------|-----|-----|
| Conservative | 15 (avg $799) | $11,985 | $143,820 |
| Moderate | 35 (avg $999) | $34,965 | $419,580 |
| Aggressive | 60 (avg $1,249) | $74,940 | $899,280 |

**Churn defense:** The prompt library gets stickier over time as teams build habits around specific workflows. Add monthly prompt drops (3-5 new prompts/month) to create an "always improving" narrative.

---

## Model 3: White-Label Licensing
### "Your Brand, Our Engine"

**Target:** Agency holding companies, consultancies, and resellers who want to offer AI tools to their network under their own brand.

**What You Sell:** A fully white-labeled version of the platform with their branding, deployed on their infrastructure, with rights to distribute to their portfolio.

**Pricing:**

| License Type | What They Get | Price | Ongoing |
|-------------|---------------|-------|---------|
| **Single Brand License** | White-labeled platform for one agency brand. Full source code. Deployment support. | **$25,000 - $50,000** | $500/mo maintenance + updates |
| **Network License** | White-label rights for up to 10 subsidiary agencies. Central admin panel. | **$75,000 - $100,000** | $2,000/mo maintenance + updates |
| **Unlimited / Full IP** | Complete IP transfer. Exclusive rights in their territory or vertical. Source code, prompts, plugins, brand, everything. | **$150,000 - $350,000** | Negotiable |

**Why this works:** Holding companies (WPP, Publicis, Omnicom, Dentsu, IPG, Havas) each have 50-200+ subsidiary agencies. If you sell a Network License to one holding company and they roll it out to 50 agencies, the effective cost per agency is $1,500-$2,000 — a rounding error in their technology budget. Meanwhile you've made $75-100K from one deal.

**Target buyers:**
- The Big 6 holding companies (WPP, Publicis, Omnicom, Dentsu, IPG, Havas)
- Regional agency networks (e.g., BBDO network, DDB network)
- Management consultancies with agency practice areas (Accenture Song, Deloitte Digital)
- AI consultancies looking for a productized delivery tool

**Sales motion:** This is a relationship sale, not a funnel sale. Target the CTO/Chief Innovation Officer at holding companies. Lead with a demo, follow with a pilot at one subsidiary, then expand to the network.

---

## Model 4: Training + Consulting Retainer
### "AI Transformation Partner"

**Target:** Agencies that need ongoing guidance, not just a tool. They want someone to help them integrate AI into their operations over 6-12 months.

**What You Sell:** The platform is the "textbook." You are the "professor." The retainer covers ongoing customization, training, prompt development, and strategic guidance.

**Retainer Structure:**

| Tier | Hours/Month | Includes | Monthly Price |
|------|------------|----------|---------------|
| **Advisory** | 5-10 hrs | Platform access + monthly strategy call + 3 new custom prompts/month + email support | **$3,000 - $5,000** |
| **Standard** | 10-20 hrs | Everything above + bi-weekly office hours + department training sessions (1/month) + 5 custom prompts/month + plugin customization | **$7,500 - $12,000** |
| **Embedded** | 20-40 hrs | Everything above + weekly calls + on-site workshops (quarterly) + unlimited custom prompts + dedicated Slack channel + executive reporting | **$15,000 - $25,000** |

**Why this works:** [AI consulting retainers](https://nicolalazzari.ai/guides/ai-consultant-pricing-us) run $5,000-$25,000/month in the market. You're not selling hours — you're selling a **platform + expertise** combination that no pure consultant can match. A McKinsey consultant gives you a PDF. You give them a PDF *and* a working tool their team uses every day.

**Revenue potential:**
- 5 Advisory clients: $15,000-$25,000/mo
- 3 Standard clients: $22,500-$36,000/mo
- 1 Embedded client: $15,000-$25,000/mo
- **Total: $52,500 - $86,000/mo ($630K - $1.03M/year)**

**Expansion play:** Every retainer client is a case study. After 6 months, document their results (time saved, workflows adopted, team satisfaction) and use it to sell the next 10 clients.

---

## Model 5: Workshop / Keynote / Event
### "The Agency AI Masterclass"

**Target:** Conference organizers, agency networks hosting offsites, and individual agencies wanting team training days.

**What You Sell:** High-impact, hands-on workshops where attendees leave with the platform installed and 5-10 workflows they can use Monday morning.

**Pricing:**

| Format | Duration | Audience | Price |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Keynote** | 45-60 min | 50-500 | $5,000 - $15,000 |
| **Half-Day Workshop** | 3-4 hrs | 10-30 | $5,000 - $10,000 |
| **Full-Day Workshop** | 6-7 hrs | 10-30 | $8,000 - $15,000 |
| **2-Day Intensive** | 12-14 hrs | 10-20 | $15,000 - $25,000 |
| **Virtual Workshop** | 2-3 hrs | 10-50 | $3,000 - $5,000 |

**Workshop agenda example (Full-Day):**

| Time | Session |
|------|---------|
| 9:00 - 9:45 | The AI Agency Landscape: What's working, what's not, and where the money is |
| 9:45 - 10:45 | Hands-On: Setting up Claude Projects for your top 3 clients |
| 11:00 - 12:00 | Department Deep-Dive: Each team picks their top 5 prompts and runs them live |
| 12:00 - 1:00 | Lunch |
| 1:00 - 2:00 | Skills & Plugins: Installing and running automated workflows |
| 2:00 - 3:00 | Advanced: Cowork desktop automation, n8n workflows, and MCP connections |
| 3:15 - 4:00 | Building Your AI Playbook: Each team commits to 3 workflows they'll use this week |
| 4:00 - 4:30 | Q&A + Next Steps |

**Why this works:** Every workshop is a sales funnel for Models 1-4. You charge for the workshop, deliver massive value, and then 30-50% of attendees convert to a subscription, implementation package, or retainer. The workshop pays for itself — everything else is profit.

**Upsell path:**
- Workshop attendee → Starter subscription ($499/mo)
- Workshop attendee → Essentials implementation ($15,000)
- Conference keynote → 3-5 inbound leads → $50K-$150K pipeline

## Revenue Model: The Full Stack

Running all five models simultaneously creates a diversified, resilient business:

| Model | Revenue Type | Year 1 (Conservative) | Year 2 (Growth) | Year 3 (Scale) |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Productized Packages** | Project | $150,000 | $300,000 | $500,000 |
| **SaaS Subscriptions** | Recurring | $100,000 | $300,000 | $600,000 |
| **White-Label Licenses** | Project + Recurring | $75,000 | $200,000 | $400,000 |
| **Retainers** | Recurring | $180,000 | $400,000 | $700,000 |
| **Workshops / Events** | Project | $50,000 | $120,000 | $200,000 |
| **TOTAL** | | **$555,000** | **$1,320,000** | **$2,400,000** |

**Recurring revenue %:**
- Year 1: ~50% (retainers + SaaS)
- Year 2: ~60%
- Year 3: ~65%+
